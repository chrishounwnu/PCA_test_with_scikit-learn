## PCA Implementation in Python
This repository contains a simple implementation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using Python and the scikit-learn library. 
PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms data into a set of uncorrelated variables called principal components, while retaining most of the information.

#Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique used to reduce the dimensionality of data while preserving as much variance as possible. 
This implementation demonstrates how to:

> Center the data.

> Compute the covariance matrix.

> Extract eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

> Project the data onto the principal components.

### Requirements
To run this code, you need the following Python libraries:

> numpy

> scikit-learn

> matplotlib

You can install the required libraries using:
> pip install numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
